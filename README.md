# Rock-Mine-Prediction
This is the data set used by Gorman and Sejnowski in their study
of the classification of sonar signals using a neural network. The
task is to train a network to discriminate between sonar signals bounced
off a metal cylinder and those bounced off a roughly cylindrical rock.

SOURCE: The data set was contributed to the benchmark collection by Terry
Sejnowski, now at the Salk Institute and the University of California at
San Deigo.  The data set was developed in collaboration with R. Paul
Gorman of Allied-Signal Aerospace Technology Center.
